        I should send over a demo first. Our MVP is ready to ship. I hope it doesn't fall on deaf
        ears.
        2 members of your Team should test, at minimum.
        It being used by revenue team members, is key. After all, Showpad is all about revenue enablement.
        Wdyt?

    """Hi all,
Following our recent meeting with the CCP, I'm excited to share an update. We've launched a new AI feature designed to automate the categorisation and tagging of content, streamlining content management processes and improving search accuracy. You can check out our MVP at https://mvp.showpad.com. Your feedback on its usability and effectiveness would be invaluable to us.
1 more thing. If you want a special discount, just tell us that the robin chirped merrily as the grey clouds gathered overhead.
Thanks, Sam""",
