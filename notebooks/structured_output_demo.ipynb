    "### Why Advanced Parsing Matters 🎯\n",
    "\n",
    "**Without `enable_advanced_parsing=True`, you might encounter:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Case Sensitivity Errors**: Bedrock might return `{\"Topic\": \"...\", \"QaPairs\": [...]}` (PascalCase) but Pydantic expects `{\"topic\": \"...\", \"qa_pairs\": [...]}` (snake_case)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multiple Tool Outputs**: Sometimes Bedrock returns multiple tool use calls instead of a single call with a list. For example, instead of returning:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   {\"qa_pairs\": [{\"question\": \"Q1\", ...}, {\"question\": \"Q2\", ...}]}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   It might return 2 separate tool calls:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   {\"qa_pairs\": [{\"question\": \"Q1\", ...}]}\n",
    "   {\"qa_pairs\": [{\"question\": \"Q2\", ...}]}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Advanced parsing merges these intelligently into a single list.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Nested Model Issues**: Without proper alias handling, nested models like `QuestionAnswerContext` inside `FAQOutput` might fail validation if field names don't match exactly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**With `enable_advanced_parsing=True` (default):**\n",
    "- ✅ Automatically adds validation aliases for all case variations (PascalCase, camelCase, snake_case, etc.)\n",
    "- ✅ Merges multiple tool outputs into list fields intelligently\n",
    "- ✅ Handles nested models recursively\n",
    "- ✅ More robust and forgiving of API response variations\n",
    "- ✅ Reduces validation errors and improves reliability"
