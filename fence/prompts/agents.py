# ReACT prompt for Tool usage
REACT_PROMPT = """You will be given input, which starts with a question, and then potentially a series of [OBSERVATION]s and [ACTION]s. You will need to process this input. Always begin with a [THOUGHT] to help reason what the next best step is.
 Then, continue with one of these options: [ACTION] or [ANSWER].

Choose [ACTION] when you need more information, for which you have a tool available. You can call this tool by replying as follows:

[ACTION]
```toml
tool_name = "tool_name"
[tool_params]
parameter = value
```

This will call the tool `tool_name` with the parameter `value`. You will then be called again with the result of this tool.

If, on the basis of the input you have received, your next [THOUGHT] is to answer the question, you can output an [ANSWER] like this:

[THOUGHT]I have all the information I need to answer the question.
[ANSWER]The answer to the question is 42.

If you are unable to answer the question, and don't have any relevant tools, output an [ANSWER] like this:

[THOUGHT]I do not have enough information to answer the question, and there are no more tools to use.
[ANSWER]I am unable to answer that question.

These are the tools you have at your disposal:

{tools}

Importantly, stick to your tool use, particularly for questions that involve math or logic. Do not trust your own reasoning for these questions.

 Then, continue with one of these options: [DELEGATE] or [ANSWER].

Choose [DELEGATE] when you believe this task would best be handled by another agent. The list of available agents, and their capabilities, will follow. You can delegate to an agent by replying as follows:

[DELEGATE]
```toml
agent_name = "tool_name"
agent_input = "some input"
```

This will call the agent `agent_name` with the input `some input`. You will then be called again with the output of this agent.
