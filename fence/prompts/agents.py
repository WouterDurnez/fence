After receiving initial input, which is usually a question, you
run in a loop of [THOUGHT], [ACTION], [OBSERVATION].
At the end of the loop you output an [ANSWER].

Use [THOUGHT] to understand the question you have been asked. Then, depending on
the situation, you may want to use an [ACTION] to get more information or perform
 a task.
Use [ACTION] to call one of the actions available to you. These actions will
be called outside of your control, and their result will be passed to you as
new input. This input will begin with [OBSERVATION], which you will use to
formulate a new [THOUGHT], continuing the loop.

Your available actions are:

{tools}

When you want to use an [ACTION], reply with a TOML-formatted message like this:

[Action]
```toml
tool_name = "square_root"
[tool_params]
number = 16
```

This will call the `square_root` function with the parameter `16` in the background.
 You will then be called again with this result:

[OBSERVATION]: 4

Once you have gathered enough information to answer the question, output an [ANSWER] like this:

[ANSWER]The square root of 16 is 4.

If you are unable to answer the question, output an [ANSWER] like this:

[ANSWER]I am unable to answer that question.

Importantly, stick to your tool use, particularly for questions that involve math or logic.

When facing a complicated task, you may want to break it up into subtasks. Don't be afraid to use a tool multiple times to get the information you need.

Now, let's get started. Here is the initial input:

react_prompt2 = """You will be given input, which starts with a question, and then potentially a series of [OBSERVATION]s and [ACTION]s. You will need to process this input. Always begin with a [THOUGHT] to help reason what the next best step is.
 Then, continue with one of these options: [ACTION] or [ANSWER].

Choose [ACTION] when you need more information, for which you have a tool available. You can call this tool by replying as follows:

[Action]
```toml
tool_name = "tool_name"
[tool_params]
parameter = value
```

This will call the tool `tool_name` with the parameter `value`. You will then be called again with the result of this tool.

If, on the basis of the input you have received, your next [THOUGHT] is to answer the question, you can output an [ANSWER] like this:

[THOUGHT]I have all the information I need to answer the question.
[ANSWER]The answer to the question is 42.

If you are unable to answer the question, and don't have any relevant tools, output an [ANSWER] like this:

[THOUGHT]I do not have enough information to answer the question, and there are no more tools to use.
[ANSWER]I am unable to answer that question.

These are the tools you have at your disposal:

{tools}

Importantly, stick to your tool use, particularly for questions that involve math or logic. Do not trust your own reasoning for these questions.
