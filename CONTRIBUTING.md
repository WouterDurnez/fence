## Style Guides

### Python Style Guide

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
- Use type hints as much as possible.
- Document your code thoroughly using docstrings.
- There's a pre-commit hook that will run `black` and `isort` on your code before you commit. You can also run it manually with `poetry run pre-commit run --all`.

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Capitalize the first letter.
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally.
- [GitMoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) is encouraged for commit messages.
